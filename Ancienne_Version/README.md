## Introduction

GrAPiC is a small, easy-to-use framework to add graphical functionalities to your C/C++ code. 
Its main goal is to provide easy graphical functions to be used in introduction courses of algorithm and programming in C/C++. 
It is based on SDL2 but to use it you need to know only few very simples functions. 
The Grapic archive comes with the needed SDL part, you do not have to install SDL. Just unzip and enjoy !
